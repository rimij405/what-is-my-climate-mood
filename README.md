Using the OpenWeatherAPI and the YouTubeAPI, this application will send you a music video based on a location's current time, date, and weather.

## Installation

You'll need to get API keys from the following locations:
- [Youtube Data API]
- [OpenWeatherMap API]

Then, you'll need to take the 'config.sample' file and create a 'config.json' file from its contents.
Replace the placeholder text with the appropriate information.

You should also understand JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
